Most Likely Strong Positive Correlations:
-----------------------------------------------
	Math Score ↔ Science Score
	(Typical r ≈ 0.6-0.8, as these subjects often share cognitive skills)

	Previous Grade ↔ Current Subject Scores
	(Math/English/Science scores often correlate r ≈ 0.5-0.7 with prior academic performance)

	Study Hours ↔ Academic Scores
	(Usually r ≈ 0.4-0.6 for conscientious students)

	Attendance Rate ↔ All Subject Scores
	(Often r ≈ 0.5-0.7, as attendance is foundational)

Potential Negative Correlations:
------------------------------------
	Commute Time ↔ Study Hours/Attendance
	(Longer commutes often reduce study time, r ≈ -0.3 to -0.5)

	Course Load ↔ Sleep Hours
	(Heavier loads may reduce sleep, r ≈ -0.4)

How to Verify:
==============
To get exact values from your actual correlation matrix:
Look for coefficients closest to ±1
Strong correlations typically are:
	> 0.7 (Very strong positive)
	< -0.5 (Strong negative)

Example Interpretation:
If your corrplot showed:
	math_score ~ science_score = 0.82 → Very strong
	attendance_rate ~ english_score = 0.68 → Strong
	commute_time ~ study_hours = -0.47 → Moderate negative
