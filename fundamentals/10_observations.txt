Why Median is Appropriate
=========================
For 
1. family_income:
-----------------
Right-Skewed Distribution
	Income data typically has a long right tail (few high earners).
	The median is resistant to extreme values, unlike the mean.
	Example: If 99 people earn ≤Ksh 50K and 1 earns Ksh 5M, the median stays at Ksh 50K while the mean becomes distorted.

Preserves Central Tendency
	Median represents the 50th percentile, ensuring half the population remains above/below this value.
	Critical for policy decisions (e.g., poverty line analysis).
For
2. math_score:
-----------------
Potential Outliers
	A few very low/high scores can skew the mean.
	Median ensures "typical" performance isn’t misrepresented.

Ordinal Nature
	Test scores are ordinal (e.g., 0–100 scale).
	Median better represents the "middle" performance than mean when data isn’t perfectly normal.

Empirical Support
	Studies show exam scores in Kenyan schools often cluster around median values due to:
		Standardized teaching methods
		Limited score variability in large cohorts
