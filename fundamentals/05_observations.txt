Analysis of math scores across academic performance and gender:

Key Observations
1. By Academic Performance
Ordered Trends: Math scores clearly increase with better academic performance:
Poor → Good → Average → Excellent (highest scores).
The median math score for "Excellent" students is near 90, while "Poor" performers cluster near 30.

Variability:
Excellent and Good groups show tight interquartile ranges (IQRs), indicating consistent high performance.
Poor performers have wider IQRs, suggesting greater variability in struggles.

2. By Gender
Female vs. Male:
Females generally have slightly higher medians in "Average" and "Good" categories.
Males show more outliers (e.g., extreme low/high scores) in "Poor" and "Excellent" groups.

Other Gender:
Limited data (narrow boxes/whiskers), but trends align with the broader pattern.

3. Missing Data (NA)
The "NA" academic performance group has low scores (median ~30), similar to "Poor" performers. This might indicate missing labels for struggling students.


Insights
Performance Gap: The stark difference between "Excellent" and "Poor" groups suggests math proficiency is strongly tied to overall academic performance.

Gender Nuances: Females may be more consistent in middle tiers, while males exhibit more extreme scores.

Actionable Takeaway: Investigate why "NA" students perform similarly to "Poor" students—could reflect data entry issues or a need for targeted interventions
