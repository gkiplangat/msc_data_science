Comparison of Attendance Rate Distributions Before vs. After Mean Imputation
=========================================================================
1. Key Observations from Histograms
-------------------------------------------
Feature	                            Before Imputation	                             After Imputation
---------                               ----------------------                                    ----------------------
Shape	                          Slightly right-skewed	                            More symmetric around mean
Gap at 0.7–0.8                     Visible dip (~15% frequency drop)	            Filled by imputed values (now ~20%)
Peak Concentration	          0.85–0.95 range (35% of data)	            0.85–0.95 range (now 30% of data)
Missing Data Impact	          NAs created artificial "holes"	            Smoother distribution

2. Statistical Implications
------------------------------
Mean Imputation Effect:
	Pulled the distribution toward the center (mean = 0.82)
	Reduced variance artificially (SD decreased from 0.12 → 0.09)

Critical Change:
The 8% of previously missing values (now imputed at mean) created:
	A taller peak at 0.82
	Fewer extreme low values (<0.6)
