===========================================================================

Kenyan Context Interpretation
-----------------------------------
Missing data in these variables may occur due to:
1. Family Income
	Sensitivity: Households may withhold income details due to privacy concerns or tax avoidance.

	Informal Economy: A big percentage of Kenya's workforce is informal, making income hard to quantify.

	Cultural Factors: Some communities consider financial discussions taboo.

2. Math Scores
	Absenteeism: Students may miss exams due to:
	Distance challenges (especially in arid counties)
	Child labor demands during harvest seasons
	Recording Gaps: Manual grade entry errors in rural schools.

3. Attendance Rate
	Infrastructure Issues: Schools without digital systems may have inconsistent tracking.
	Cultural Events: Traditional ceremonies can lead to unrecorded absences.
