Analysis: How weekly study hours vary between urban and rural students:
===================================================================
Key Observations
---------------------
1. Shape of Distribution:
	Both groups (Rural and Urban) show right-skewed distributions, with most students studying 10–20 hours per week and fewer at higher hours.
	Rural students exhibit a sharper peak (higher concentration around the median) compared to urban students, suggesting less variability in study habits.
	Urban students have a slightly flatter and broader distribution, indicating more diversity in study hours (e.g., some study significantly more or less than the median).

2. Count Differences:
	The rural histogram reaches a higher count (~400) at its peak, while the urban peak is lower (likely ~300). This may reflect a larger sample size for rural students or more concentrated behavior.

3. Outliers:
	Both groups have tails extending to higher study hours (e.g., 30+ hours), but urban students show a slightly longer tail, implying more extreme cases of high study time.

4. Insights
	Rural students tend to cluster around a moderate study range (e.g., 15–20 hours), possibly due to more structured routines or fewer distractions.
	Urban students display greater variability, which could stem from diverse lifestyles (e.g., part-time jobs, extracurricular activities, or access to libraries/cafés).
