Analysis: How many outliers are there, and what might they represent in a Kenyan context?
===================================================================================
Number of Outliers:
-----------------------
There are 79 outliers in the family_income variable using the 1.5Ã—IQR method.

What These Outliers Represent in a Kenyan Context:
-------------------------------------------------------------
The outliers reflect Kenya's significant income inequality and economic diversity:
1. High-Income Outliers (> 63,402 KES/month)
These likely represent:
	Urban elite: Top professionals in Nairobi (finance/tech sectors, senior government officials, UN/diplomatic staff)
	Business owners: Successful entrepreneurs in manufacturing, agriculture (tea/coffee exports), or tourism
	Diaspora households: Families receiving substantial foreign remittances (remittances account for 3.1% of Kenya's GDP)
	Landowners: Large-scale farmers with high-value crops (e.g., horticulture in Rift Valley)
	Example: A family earning 80,000 KES/month would be in Kenya's top 5% (urban).

2. Low-Income Outliers
The negative lower bound (-12,718 KES) is statistically calculated but not economically meaningful (income can't be negative). In practice:
	Extreme poverty: Households < 5,000 KES/month
	Rural subsistence farmers: Especially in ASALs (Arid and Semi-Arid Lands) like Turkana
	Informal settlements: Families in Nairobi's Kibera or Kisumu's Nyalenda slums
	Unrecorded missing data: Day laborers without stable income
