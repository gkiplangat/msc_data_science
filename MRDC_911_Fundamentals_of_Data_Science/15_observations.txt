Analysis: How does the binned variable correlate with academic_performance?
=========================================================================
Correlation coefficient = 0.0166

The correlation coefficient of 0.0166 between the binned income variable (income_binned) and academic performance (total_score) suggests:
Very Weak (Almost No) Correlation
	The value is close to 0, indicating almost no monotonic relationship between family income (binned into categories) and academic performance in your dataset.
	This means that, in your sample, students' income levels (as grouped into "Low," "Medium-Low," "Medium-High," "High") do not meaningfully predict their average academic scores.

Possible Explanations
	True Lack of Association: Income might not be a significant factor affecting academic performance in your specific sample (e.g., if the school has uniform resources or scholarships that reduce income-based disparities).
	Binning Effect: Discretizing income into broad categories might mask subtle trends that a continuous income variable could reveal.
	Other Factors: Academic performance may be influenced more strongly by variables not analyzed here (e.g., study habits, parental education, school quality).

Statistical Significance?
	The corr.test() output (not shown here) would include a p-value. If p > 0.05, the correlation is not statistically significant, reinforcing that this tiny correlation could be due to random noise.
