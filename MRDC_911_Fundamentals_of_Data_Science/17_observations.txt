What patterns suggest about student involvement?
==============================================
Patterns in Extracurricular Activities vs. Academic Performance
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Visual Pattern from Contingency Table:
	The mosaic plot shows no dramatic differences in academic performance distribution across activity types
	Students with no extracurricular involvement show slightly higher proportions of "Poor" performance
	Students in "Both" activities show marginally better "Excellent" performance rates
	No single activity type dominates across all performance levels

Statistical Test Result:
	Pearson's Chi-squared test
	X-squared = 4.8156, df = 9, p-value = 0.8501
	High p-value (0.85 > 0.05) indicates no statistically significant association
	The differences observed are likely due to random variation, not systematic patterns
