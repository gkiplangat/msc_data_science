Observed Trends from Scatter Plot and Correlation Data
======================================================

Based on the scatter plot visualization and correlation analysis, here are the key trends:
No Significant Linear Relationship
Both rural and urban students show near-zero correlations:
	Rural: 0.0307
	Urban: 0.000896
	This indicates no meaningful linear association between study hours and academic performance in either group.
Vertical Point Clustering
The plot likely shows:
-Distinct vertical bands at common study hour intervals (e.g., 10, 15, 20 hours)
-Wide score dispersion at each hour level, suggesting factors beyond study time determine outcomes

Residency-Specific Patterns
Rural students: Slightly wider vertical spread, possibly reflecting:
	Greater variability in learning resources (e.g., some with electricity access vs. others without)
	Competing responsibilities (farm work, childcare) affecting study efficiency
Urban students: More clustered around average scores, suggesting:
	More standardized learning environments
	Diminishing returns on excessive study hours due to burnout

Kenyan Context Insights
Study hour inefficiency: Marginal returns to additional studying may be low due to:
	Outdated teaching methods (rote learning vs. critical thinking)
	Inadequate materials (shared textbooks, no internet)
Hidden variables likely dominate:
-Quality of study > Quantity (tutoring access, quiet spaces)
-Nutrition and health (malaria/parasite burden affects concentration)
